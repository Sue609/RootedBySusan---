# 🌳 RootedBySusan - My Growth. My code. My Journey.

> "Every project plants a new root - and from each one, I grow stronger"

Hey there 👋🏽  
I’m **Susan**, a curious developer on a journey to build, break, learn, and grow 🌿.  


**RootedBySusan** is not just a portfolio project - it's my *digital growth garden*.
Each commit is a seed. Each project, a branch.
And together, they tell my story - how I started with basic HTML and Go APIs, and kept going even when nothing seemes to work.
