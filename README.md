# 🌳 RootedBySusan - My Growth. My code. My Journey.

> "Every project plants a new root - and from each one, I grow stronger"

Hey there 👋🏽  
I’m **Susan**, a curious developer on a journey to build, break, learn, and grow 🌿.  


**RootedBySusan** is not just a portfolio project - it's my *digital growth garden*.

Each commit is a seed. Each project, a branch.

And together, they tell my story - how I started with basic HTML and Go APIs, and kept going even when nothing seemes to work.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This is my ongoing full-stack project - a space where I experiment, learn, and grow as a developer.

The goal isn't just to build a website, but to document the journey of improving my skills in **JavaScript, Frontend Design and Backend Development**

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Current & Future Plans)

| Layer | Stack | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 🌸 Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(transitioning to React / Next.js)* | Designing for clarity & responsiveness |
| ⚙️ Backend | Go (and later Node.js / Express) | Building REST APIs, logic & structure |
| ☁️ Deployment | Netlify / Vercel | Continuous testing & quick feedback |
| 🧠 Learning Focus | DSA + JS Mastery | Strengthening logic & problem-solving |

## 💡 Vision

> To build projects that don’t just look good — they *teach me something new.*  

This portfolio will evolve with me.  
I’ll document not just finished projects, but also *what went wrong*, what I improved,  
and how I grew through it all.

## 🌱 How to Explore My Work

You’ll find:
- **Mini-projects** → quick builds that sharpen my skills  
- **Full-stack experiments** → merging backend logic with creative frontends  
- **Visual playgrounds** → interactive UIs where I test design ideas  

Each section reflects a phase of my learning.  
Every click tells a story 🌿
