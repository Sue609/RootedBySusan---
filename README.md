# 🌳 RootedBySusan - My Growth. My code. My Journey.

> "Every project plants a new root - and from each one, I grow stronger"

Hey there 👋🏽  
I’m **Susan**, a curious developer on a journey to build, break, learn, and grow 🌿.  


**RootedBySusan** is not just a portfolio project - it's my *digital growth garden*.

Each commit is a seed. Each project, a branch.

And together, they tell my story - how I started with basic HTML and Go APIs, and kept going even when nothing seemes to work.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This is my ongoing full-stack project - a space where I experiment, learn, and grow as a developer.

The goal isn't just to build a website, but to document the journey of improving my skills in **JavaScript, Frontend Design and Backend Development**

## 🧭 Vision & Direction  

This portfolio will evolve in **three clear phases**:  

### 🪴 Phase 1 — Foundation (Current)
- Build the front-end layout using ****HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(transitioning to React / Next.js)****
- Prioritize **responsiveness and clarity** over complexity  
- Create a clear structure for sections: *About, Projects, Tech Stack, Contact*  
- Set up hosting on **Netlify / Vercel**

### 🌼 Phase 2 — Interactivity & Personality  
- Add animations, transitions, and subtle motion design  
- Implement a project showcase section (with filters/tags)
- Integrate dynamic content (e.g. project data fetched from JSON or API)
- Start integrating backend routes using Go or Node.js

### 🌳 Phase 3 — Full-Stack Integration  
- Migrate the project to **Next.js or a Go + React stack**  
- Add a simple backend for contact forms or project updates  
- Deploy full stack on Render / Vercel  
- Optimize SEO and accessibility for portfolio visibility

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Current & Future Plans)

| Layer | Stack | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 🌸 Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(transitioning to React / Next.js)* | Designing for clarity & responsiveness |
| ⚙️ Backend | Go (and later Node.js / Express) | Building REST APIs, logic & structure |
| ☁️ Deployment | Netlify / Vercel | Continuous testing & quick feedback |
| 🧠 Learning Focus | DSA + JS Mastery | Strengthening logic & problem-solving |

## 💡 Core Lessons Guiding This Build  

🧩 **1. Commit Often — Especially on Frontend**  
Tiny changes break things. Frequent commits = peace of mind.  

🧪 **2. Test as You Go**  
Waiting till the end hides problems. I fix as I build.  

🎨 **3. Design for All Screens Early**  
Mobile-first thinking from the start.  

⚙️ **4. Keep Backend Logic Simple**  
Functions should do *one thing well*.  

🚀 **5. Deploy Early, Learn Faster**  
Seeing my work live keeps me accountable.  

🧠 **6. Clarity Over Complexity**  
Readable, logical, and explainable code — always.

## 🌱 Philosophy  

> “A good developer doesn’t aim to impress — they aim to *improve*.”  

This project is my way of embracing both code and chaos.  

Some days the code will break, some days it’ll flow beautifully —  
but every day, I’ll show up.  

The goal isn’t perfection.  
It’s **progress**, **patience**, and **purpose**.  

---

## 🌱 How to Explore My Work

You’ll find:
- **Mini-projects** → quick builds that sharpen my skills  
- **Full-stack experiments** → merging backend logic with creative frontends  
- **Visual playgrounds** → interactive UIs where I test design ideas  

Each section reflects a phase of my learning.  
Every click tells a story 🌿
